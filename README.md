How do you know when to chill or when to grind?

Analyze your heart-rate interval data to get the answers you have always sought

Get metrics that will allow you to learn what times are good to fall asleep, to work, to eat, et cetera...

Basically this module shows you when your parasympathetic nervous system is dominant and when your sympathetic system is dominant, and what their balance is like

# Metrics
For fun and hopefully to find the most accurate solutions, we'll use the following metrics:

0) Detrended fluctuation analysis
1) Multi-fractal detrended fluctuation analysis
2) Hsi indicator
3) Fundamnetal (cepstrum) Hsi
4) Standard deviation of successive differences
5) Standard deviation of NN intervals
6) Root mean square of successive differences
7) LF/HF ratio
8) Heart-rate
